I am a graduate student at Texas A&M University pursuing a M.S. [Nuclear Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/nuclear/index.html) degree. I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant for Dr. Mark Kimber. I am involved with the Molten Salt Research Reactor (MSRR) project that is being funded by [Natura Resources](https://naturaresources.org/). My role in the project is to work along with a team to develop a program called SyTH that will analyze the system thermal-hydraulics of the molten salt reactor.

In December 2023, I graduated with a B.S. [Mechanical Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/index.html) degree from Texas A&M University.

On Aug. 14-18, 2023, I attended the [17th International Heat Transfer Conference (IHTC-17)](https://ihtc17.org/) to share my research work. This conference has published my first conference paper.

I have programming experience in several languages: primarily Python and C++. I enjoy using software development to solve engineering problems, model real world physics and to visualize data.
