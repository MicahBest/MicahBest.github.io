I am an undergraduate student at Texas A&M University. I am studying Mechanical Engineering. I am also performing research at Texas A&M in Dr. Mark Kimber's lab group. I am involved with the Molten Salt Research Reactor (MSRR) project that is being funded by [Natura Resources](https://naturaresources.org/). My role in the project is to work along with a team to develop a program called SyTH that will analyze the system thermal-hydraulics of the molten salt reactor.

After graduation this December (12/2023), I plan to obtain a Master's of Science in Nuclear Engineering at Texas A&M University.

On Aug. 14-18, 2023, I attended the [17th International Heat Transfer Conference (IHTC-17)](https://ihtc17.org/) to share my research work. This conference has published my first conference paper.

I have programming experience in several languages: primarily Python and C++. I enjoy using software development to solve engineering problems and to visualize data.
